# Factors associated with non-participation in anthropometric and biomarker measurements in India: an analysis of National Family Health Survey 2015-16

**Background:**     
Non-response after sample selection in large surveys is a potential source of selection bias. Research from high income settings suggest low participation rates among those belonging to lower socio-economic position groups.      

**Objective:**      
To identify factors associated with participation in anthropometric and biomarker data collection, and quantify the change in estimates from not accounting for informative missingness.     

**Methods:**      
Using data from the Indian National Family Health Survey-IV (2015-16), I identified the proportion of participants consisting of children under-5 years and adults 15-54 years (n = 1,080,681) who consensually participated in anthropometric (height, weight, blood pressure) and blood biomarker (HIV dried blood spots, hemoglobin, blood glucose) measurements and had biologically plausible values. I used multiple logistic regression, accounting for the survey design, to identify socio-demographic characteristics associated with participation in these measurements and adjusted for state fixed effects. Using inverse probability weights, I estimated IPW-adjusted estimates of prevalence for health outcomes and calculated the difference from unadjusted estimates.     

**Results:**      
Majority of adult participants provided valid data for anthropometry (%, range: 85.1 for blood pressure in men to 97.8 for height and weight in women). The proportion of eligible children under-5 who did not report anthropometry and hemoglobin was less than adults. Anthropometry had higher participation than blood biomarkers, and southern states had higher participation relative to northern states. Residence in urban areas and membership in high socio-economic position groups (post-secondary schooling, non-backward caste) were associated with lower participation for all outcomes. However, the difference between IPW-adjusted and unadjusted estimates was less than 1% for all health outcomes across population groups.     

**Conclusions:**      
Higher socio-economic position was associated lower participation in anthropometric and biomarker measurements. Prevalence estimates of health outcomes did not differ after adjusting for non-response.
